### Project - 1 - AAI - Cummins (Pune: Remote)

##### Duration: Apr 2024 to 2026 (Full Time)

#### Role: Full Stack Developer (Node.js, Azure Services React.is)

#### Goal of Commins Org: Enhance Growth with Analytics & AI( SL )

Leverage Analytics and AI to optimize processes, improve operational efficiency, and deliver data-driven insights. Utilize Descriptive and Predictive Analytics to understand trends, forecast outcomes, and recommend actions. Integrate Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automation, smarter decision-making, and enhanced customer support. Apply AI to optimize processes, detect fraud, and improve reporting. Enhance customer experience with Predictive Analytics and AI-driven recommendations.

#### Project Name: Serving Layer Middleware Project for AAI Analytics

##### Overview

The SLD project serves as a middleware layer for the AAI project, enabling seamless data consumption and integration across multiple internal Cummins systems. The middleware facilitates analytics and data fetching using GraphQL to ensure efficient data retrieval. Leveraging Azure Functions for serverless compute, Cosmos DB for scalable data storage, and KeyVault for secure management of secrets, the system supports high availability and security. Additionally, Azure Logic Apps automate workflows, while GitLab is used for version control and deployment pipelines. The project ensures smooth deployment, integration, and testing of tools with a unified interface to streamline internal processes.
